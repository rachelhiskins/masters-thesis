Mandala-3FIGURE 1-MANDALA 3	Mandala-3I had nine sittings to complete Mandala 3. I began working for 10 minutes, then 20 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 15 minutes, 15 minutes, 5 minutes, and 15 minutes and lastly ending with 30 minutes. Again I worked emergently, not thinking about what I would draw and being open to what would come through my marks. I was surprised to see some eyes in the middle of the picture when I started drawing and I began to dialogue with myself whilst making other detailed marks around these eyes.   Date: The 6th of June 2015Total: time 2 hoursMandala 3* Staring, masks, I’m watching you* Eye, stars * Eyes, can’t speak, only see* No secrets next time* Voice, emotions and thoughts* I don’t want to be in the dark and be caught out or off guard again* Sad* My eyes, body* Dropped thinking* Feeling sad that he left* Clouded* I look within* Think of people that I have not seen yet that knew us, I feel embarrassed* I feel embarrassed that he left me, why did he leave?* I feel embarrassed that I am single now* I stopped drawing * I read on Facebook that the Australian government are going to give money to Cambodian government to send some refugees there. * I am outraged!* I am embarrassed to be an Australian * I stopped drawing to write my disgust on Facebook* What a completely fucked up idea, The Australian government is aware of the corruption in Cambodia.
