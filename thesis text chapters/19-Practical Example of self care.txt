Practical Example of self careRelief- Titled: Letting it goInstantaneously I feel physically and emotional relief drawing a mandala. It is dramatically astounding how much I have healed with each line and especially after each mandala. As I have stated, I have kept a mandala diary over the last 2 years and this is a small example of the self care aspect. As a result, I was able to let go of the emotional wounds and I feel that this process has liberated me from the destruction that I once felt. The next four mandalas depict the exploration I went on to express my uncertainty about finding out that my former partner was dishonest. I first went through shock, resentment and anger again finding out he was dishonest. However, I quickly shifted and I no longer am weighed down by this dishonesty. I disconnected from the negativity and the emotions that I once felt to quickly resurfaced into being empathetic, strong, confident and proud. FIGURE 1-KEPT IN THE DARKI drew this mandala when I found out from a friend the week before my former partner married one of our Khmer friends. It was 1 year and 7 months after our relationship ended. FIGURE 2-PISSED OFFInitially, I was pissed off with the deceit and lies that my former partner concealed and still has not owned. FIGURE 3-HURT OTHERS COULD NOT BE HONESTI felt hurt that the people around me that knew and said nothing. FIGURE 4- LETTING GO OF THE BULLSHIT AND REALIZING THERE IS SO MUCH MORE OUT THEREThrough these mandalas I now feel that the universe is bigger and I am resilient and a strong woman. It is interesting to note that I am not affected by their relationship, however being lied too and disrespected was frustrating. All I wanted was clarity and to understand, but amazingly through this inquiry I was able to create clarity for myself, which was much more powerful and empowering than I could have hoped for.
