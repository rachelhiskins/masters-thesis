My exploration takes you through numerous mandalas as well as a tattoo synthesis which is an embodiment of my new knowings’. As a result, I consistently had therapeutic moments and correspondingly aligned my needs and values with my authentic self. This inquiry has become a journey of meaning making and such a powerful and empowering 2 years, as I started out broken but I have finished whole. ContentsIntroduction Mandala 1Mandala Table of ContentsNo headings found.This is an automatic table of contents.
