\chapter{My findings}

It is important to say that writing my thesis has been a therapeutic endeavour. As a result, I have grown and feel I have become more authentic in the way I relate to others and to myself. Importantly, as I inquired into the experiences of drawing mandalas, I actually experienced significant benefits. Like Jung, I too experienced a transformation of sorts through this process. Jung also used mandala drawing as a way of making sense of his experience. He wrote:Ê

ÒI sketched every morning in a notebook a small circular drawingÉwhich seemed to correspond to my inner situation at the timeÉWith the help of these drawings I could observe my psychic transformation from day to dayÉ
      Only gradually did I discover what the mandala really isÉFormation, Transformations...
      Mandalas were cryptograms concerning the state of the self which were presented to me anew everyday. In them I saw the self- that is my whole being-actively at work. To be sure, at first I could only dimly understand them, but they seemed to me highly significant, and I guarded them like precious pearlsÓ (Jung, 1963, P. 187).

In order to form my findings in a coherent manner, I returned to the inquiry process define my emerging understanding of the power of mandala drawing in therapeutic endeavours. To this end I selected keywords that most strongly resonated with me in my own creative process of drawing mandalas that I have previously documented, as well as the resonant key phrases from the participantsÕ reflections. I clustered these phrases and created titles for each cluster. I also drew a mandala for the 10 clusters titles. I became aware that each mandala is illustrative of the therapeutic work I do. The following are the phrases and key words that were most resonant:

1. Repetition
* ÔRepetition is calmingÕ
2. Mindfulness
* ÔTrying to keep a consistent pattern when drawing but letting go of the fact that each line will never be the sameÕ
* ÔPractice listening to our emotions, thoughts, feelings, as well as our bodiesÕ
* ÔIntuitiveÕ
3. Processing
*  ÔUse no measurements, just my felt sense when I drawÕ
* ÔHaving a break helps to process and evaluate where my emotions and thoughts areÕ
4. Hypnotic/ Focusing
* Fixed on the process and not the end result- concentrating and focusing on each lineÕ
* ÔI became lost in the stillness at timesÕ
5. Emergence
* ÔSymbology seems to emerge within the process without thoughtÕ
6. Decelerate/ Calming
* ÔSlowing down all my thoughts and feelingsÕ
7. Self expression
* ÔProviding me with a dialogue to better understand my unconsciousness and connect me with my own visual languageÕ
8. Connections/Awareness
* ÔFascinated by what it might have to teach meÕ
* ÔWhat the symbols represents as well as what resonates for me now. As well as becoming aware of our bodies, mind and thoughtsÕ
9. Self care
* ÔDebriefing toolÕ
* ÔSelf careÕ
* ÔDifference perspectiveÕ
* ÔConnecting to our emotionsÕ
10. Relief
* ÔA sense of relief from my emotional contentÕ
* ÔSelf-reflectiveÕ
*  ÔThe process has a transformative quality- which I feel heals old patterns and emotional woundsÕ
* ÔI felt held by remaining within the circlesÕ
To create a more focused findings sections of this thesis, I decided to combine some clusters, thereby reducing the number of clusters from 10 to 5. Each of the 5 sections that follow include the cluster titles, the mandalas and references to the relevant literature.  

Section 1 
Mandala: 
* Self expression (bold) 
Section 1 sets the scene for how a mandala can be introduced within the therapeutic setting. I feel self expression is integral to arts therapy practice, but also to each of us, whether this expression occurs visually or in other modalities. I did not want to cluster this mandala with any other. 

Section 2
Mandala:
* Repetition
* Mindfulness
* Processing 
* Hypnotic/ focusing 
* Decelerate/calming
* Connection/awareness 
Section 2 speaks about how the making of a mandala is an embodied action. I clustered the 6 mandalas above as there is a similarity in the way each speak of embodied action with the mandala.

Section 3
Mandala:
* Emergence
In section 3 I address the emergence and importance of re looking within the process of working with mandalas in a therapeutic context.

Section 4
Mandala:
* Self care 
In section 4 I describe the broader application of self care and the value for the therapist in practicing ways of regulating their own emotional experience. As therapists, we encounter exceedingly energetic emotions in arts therapy sessions, we need to take care of ourselves, so we can better serve the other.

Section 5
Mandala:
* Relief
In section 5, I conclude my thesis by coming back to my experience of my embodied and mindful conversations within mandalas. I give a practical example of my journey of experiencing a relief from distress and un ease. I also describe my process of getting a tattoo. I feel this process was a creative synthesis; an expression of my embodied knowing.
