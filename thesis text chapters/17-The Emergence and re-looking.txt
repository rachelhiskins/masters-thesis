The Emergence and re-looking process of a mandalaEmergence- Titled: Feeling within the wobblesThe mandala process is an emergent process. I feel being OK within the wobbles and trusting that our journey of co-creation within our mandalas, assists us to experience all of our experiencing in a more fulfilled and meaningful way. McNiff (1998) states “trusting the process is based on a belief that something valuable will emerge when we step into the unknown” (p. 27) I really feel as though I trusted my process of stepping into the conversations within mandalas, knowing that something important will flourish from my experience within this process. McNiff (1998) states “withhold your desire for outcomes. You don’t want to be at ‘the end’ of the process when you are just beginning or in the thick of it” (p 116). Of course there was a part of me that just wanted to skip to the end where I understood everything and felt good again. But “rather than blunting the awareness of my conflicts through avoidance, I try to stay close to them, to directly engage their power to transform.” (McNiff, 2004, p. 54). As I have stated before, the mandala process is not a problem solve activity. Even though, in the end it may have this quality, it rests in an intuitive and emergent arena, where “the mind is a self organizing emergent process, that is both embodied and relational, which regulates the flow of energy and information” (Dr Dan, 2012, Retrieved: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVYd1W4iAm0,
