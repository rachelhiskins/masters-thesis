Mandala-4
With mandala 4, I had a very different process than with the previous mandalas. Previously the mandalas have been created without thought or direction. I had the following question enter my mind immediately before drawing this mandala and the question sat within me. So I posed the question over and over whilst drawing:

ÒHow can you leave after 12 years and never once say you were unhappy? 
How can you leave after 12 years and never once say you were unhappy?
How can you leave after 12 years and never once say you were unhappy?
How can you leave after 12 years and never once say you were unhappyÉ?Ó

When I drew in the inside circle I thought:
* We grew so much together 
* Thought we had a beautiful relationship 
* Remembering the wonderful trips, we had together 
And the outside circle I thought over and over:
* Now itÕs empty without you
* I am mad, you never said anything
* I am mad you just left
* I am mad you left without warning 
* I am mad that I do not understand why
* I am mad that I did not see it coming
* I am mad you gave up on us
* I am mad that you never shared what was inside you especially when I gave you ample space to 
* I am just fucking mad!

Mandala 4

After feeling such aggression and anger drawing within this Mandala, I felt I needed to try and put myself in his shoes and so I wrote this letter back to myself from what could have been Òhis perspectiveÓ. This has surely baffled me and it is lovely to have some distance from the emotional content of the experience now. I can just think and wonder without crying uncontrollably, how did that happen? 

I looked and then dialogued with the image and I kept hearing my former partners voice and so he said:

Dear Rachel 
I am sorry, I am so so sorry I made you cry uncontrollably and could not explain myself. I shut down, there was so much going on in my head and heart that I could not name. It broke my heart to see you shatter into pieces right in front of me. All I really wanted to do is comfort you and say that it would be ok. But I was so confused. Was I making the right decision to leave? I did feel caught off guard as well with what was happening within me. I was overcome with sadness about being home and was unhappy with my life and what have I achieved Rachel. Rachel I did not want to drag you down. I acknowledge that you have been craving to do your Masters and I could not interfere with that any longer and I will make sure that I do not get in your way to achieve your goals. You have sacrificed so much for me, but when it was time for me to step up, I could not. I am eternally sorry that I could not give you what you wanted. All I really know is that I was not giving you what you deserved and desired and I love you, but not enough to stay, so unfortunately itÕs time to separate and I have to let you go in the hope that you can find a man who can shower you with affection and love. I hope you can find someone who is not fearful of the future and wants to settle down with you so that one day you can have the baby that you have always wanted. 
Thank you for all the years of friendship, love and care. 
It was an honour to have been your partner for 12 years and I hope you can forgive me one day.
