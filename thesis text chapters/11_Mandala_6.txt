Mandala-6
With mandala 6 I felt Abandoned and wanted to create what that felt like and what that looked like for me through the mandala. I did not think of any symbols and remained open for me to draw without pre planning anything. Towards the end of drawing, I felt like my mandala was spinning and felt how he abandoned me. I had a couple sittings totalling around 1 hour and 45 minutes. I felt the cross hatch marks connects mandala 6 to mandala 4 as both have the same feeling of abandonment. I was not conscious of this whilst making them.

Mandala 6
Abandonment
My felt sense of when my ex ended our 12 year relationship was abandonment. I felt like he ran away before I was able to understand and speak with him about why it was ending, especially when we had never spoken of this and to add to the confusion only months earlier we talked about strengthening our relationship and got engaged.  
* Start off with the petal, the same as usual 
* My hands are cold, IÕm rugged up, the weather is cold, but nice outside with blue skies. I like looking outside siting at my desk, itÕs really windy
* My back is sore, I sneeze. I think I would like a swivel chair as I write on the computer on the side of my architecture desk
* I wonder when I should go to the gym this week
* I am looking forward to school, but am I up to date with everything?
* Did I start writing already, I forgot
* IÕm excited because I rub a circle out and extended the shapes out. I normally keep the lines and establish dots at least to provided boundaries between the movement of shapes 
* IÕve got heart burn
* Oh there goes someone else getting married, another child, and I am single, nice one! 
* Why could you not commit? What was so awful about me and spending life with me?
* .2 pen has dried up
* The doors have slammed shut for a reason Rachel

* Stretch elbow, turn page 
* Reminds me of a bee

* The Sails are up and off 
* Eagle eyes 
* Dots
* Feel tired 
* Tight, thirsty 
The mandala reminds me straight away of throwing stars, orÊa shurikenÊthrowing blade. I know nothing of martial arts or the meaning behind what a shuriken represents, just what I have seen in movies. 

Reflecting on this mandala I became playful within my imagination and dialoguing with the image was easy as prominent voices arose and I automatically envisaged myself as a ninja. 

I visualized this shuriken thrown at me, piercing right through my heart and coming out the other end, as well as many other shuriken piercing my back and slicing off parts of me. I vividly pictured this happening and felt this pain in my body. 

It was a fierce battle, the ninja who defeated me was quick, concise and climbed the wall to his escape, never to return. I felt abandoned. It has taken almost a year to mend the wounds. But I have special healing powers and have a black belt in karate now, haaaya! Yes I have become a warrior, a ninja and have my power back. The spikes in the mandala now sense the negativity around me and slice them off to leave the positive strands. I move with the movement; I am one with the energy around. I shift and expand my awareness. I fight for me to get what I want and deserve, Haaya! I am centred and able to throw the stars out and receive back the good. I am balanced and able to teach others to dig deep within themselves in order to battle the scars of their emotions. I am patient with myself and allow all my emotions to communicate. This shuriken is now saying ÔHaaayaÕ, things are always shifting Rach! Move, Move, Move.
