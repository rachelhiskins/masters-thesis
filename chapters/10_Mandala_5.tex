%Mandala-5
Again the intention of mandala 5 was an emergent process. Before drawing the Mandala, I had the urge to only draw a Mandala with colours and no pen detail, so I purely focused on shading inside the Mandala. 
Date: The 8th of June 2015
Total: 1 hour and 15 minutes

%Mandala 5
Zone in, not thinking of anything 
Concentrating on colouring in
Want to use many colours within the same colour, blend them
Start with orange to fill the middle of the circle with yellow edges reminds me of the sun, the sun we have within us
Pink and tender around
Thin lined purple and blue around the orange and yellow middle circle 
Light blue around the pink 
I want to be free from him
I colour with green now
Now brown circle, grounding myself letting go of my connection with him
I listen to the sound of the pencil making the sound on the paper and the music 
Feel relaxed in my emotions 
Blending orange with the brown 


Dialogue with the mandala:

Mandala:
Here we are again Rachel
Let's concentrate on the here and now
It is time to let go, time to be at peace with him leaving
The centre of you is bright and warm
You deserve to be nurtured, surround yourself with that, make new friends
Ground yourself in the present moment, become mindful of the beauty around you
Let go of the hate and anger of having to start over, whilst it seems that everyone around you is having kids and moving on
Perhaps you will never have kids and that is not his fault 

Me:
But he kept saying let's wait for years and years. I loved him so much that I patiently waited. 
But then was shocked, when he said he didn't want kids and that we should break up. I would have happily chosen our relationship over having children and if I had the choice I would have happily travelled the world with him. He said I would resent him if we didn't have kids, but I have NEVER resented him in the 12 years and I am annoyed he never gave me the opportunity to explore our relationship without kids. As we had been discussing kids for many years, I assumed he would want to when he felt ready. I only wanted a child because I loved him and wanted to create a little us. But it is so different now because I look at children in a different way, I no longer feel my body clock or have the drive to want to have a child of my own. 

Mandala:
Rach he did not stay with you for 12 years and purposely wait to orchestrate breaking your heart and take those baby bearing years from you
He in fact stayed with you because he loved you, and just became petrified to take the next step of having a family together
He did not take anything from you Rachel, you still have potentially around 4 years of fertility left.  

Me: 
But he did take the choice away from me and I am resentful for that. The choice to choose if I was willing to not have children in our relationship

Mandala:
But Rach do you not want to be with someone who is fearless in love and someone who is emotionally in touch with themselves, as well as someone who can communicate their needs and is able to compromise with you? 

Me:
Yes, I do. And I know at the end of the day, I want to be with someone that wants to be with me because they love me, it is as simple as that. I want a man that can commit to me and not be fearful of the future together. 

Mandala:
Anyway, back to the present, you have new light and new direction 
You are grounded and just be proud of who you are
Keep growing Rachel
