%Mandala-2
Similar to the first Mandala, I created this Mandala without a preconceived idea of what I might explore. I remained present to what I was thinking, feeling and simply drew what first came to mind. I had 4 sittings; the first was 25 minutes, then 1 hour and 30 minutes, 25 minutes and 2 hours. I mapped out the outer lines with a compass and intuitively immersed myself in what came next. The first image which came to the surface was 4 little heads and for some reason they unsettled me so I felt as though I needed to cross hatch over them to mask them in. I went on a voyage through my little symbols which amplified my needs in that moment.

I then dialogued with image:
The centre of the image said to me:

\begin{table}[htp]

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
Look behind, look through, look beyond
Brave the winter and peoples reactions
There are different parts of yourself that have been hidden
They are becoming more transparent and their own desires and needs are no longer on the back burner, they are coming to the surface
Flourishing 
Growth
The seeds have been planted
Trust the new path and experiences, as they will serve you
Swim in the water of unknowing, and trust the path along the mountainÕs ridge. 
Be still in each moment and let go of the unnecessary burdens you carry in your body
Stand tall and strive for what you love, there is so much within you
Link arms with friends and family and create a tight circle of friends and family who support and nurture your very being. 
Surround yourself with people that are affirming, optimistic and playful. 
Hold the shield up Rachel, be strong and a warrior, fight off the negativity and self-doubt. You are fast, agile and fluid. 
Ride the next wave Rach! Commit fully and enjoy the ride.
